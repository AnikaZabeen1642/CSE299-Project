# medi_app

Aa mobile app using Flutter in Android Studio. It has three features. 1st, it will have a medicine reminder feature with notifications. Users can add up to 30 medicines at a time. It will also have a medicine search feature. It will also have a search by location function that will allow users to find nearby hospitals and list of doctors at those hospitals. This will be achieved using a database that we will manually create. we will use MongoDB for database. Please provide me a flowchart for the work of this project.
